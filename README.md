# Typer Fun

## What is this?

I've just discovered [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/), a library for building command-line interfaces (CLIs) in Python. It's built on top of Click and uses Python's type hints to provide a simple and intuitive way to create CLIs.

This is [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) sibling.

## Why?

Instead of adding this to my bookmarks, I will just go ahead and create a repo for it. I will add more examples as I learn more about Typer.
